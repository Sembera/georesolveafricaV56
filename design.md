# Georesolve Africa - Design Style Guide

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Language
- **Scientific Precision**: Clean, methodical layouts that reflect geological accuracy and professional expertise
- **East African Context**: Warm earth tones and natural textures that connect to the regional landscape
- **Modern Professionalism**: Contemporary design that instills confidence in technical capabilities
- **Accessibility First**: Clear contrast ratios and readable typography for all users

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: #345363 (Deep Teal) - Professional, trustworthy, scientific
- **Secondary**: #9EDB9E (Sage Green) - Natural, sustainable, growth
- **Accent**: #4DA34D (Forest Green) - Action, success, reliability
- **Neutral**: White, Black, Gray scale for balance and readability
- **Earth Tones**: Warm browns and beiges as supporting colors

### Typography
- **Display Font**: "Playfair Display" - Elegant serif for headings, conveys expertise and tradition
- **Body Font**: "Inter" - Modern sans-serif for excellent readability and professional appearance
- **Technical Font**: "JetBrains Mono" - Monospace for data, coordinates, and technical specifications

## Visual Effects & Animation

### Core Libraries Used
1. **Anime.js** - Smooth micro-interactions and element animations
2. **ECharts.js** - Data visualizations for geological data and project metrics
3. **p5.js** - Interactive geological visualizations and background effects
4. **Splide.js** - Image carousels for project galleries
5. **Matter.js** - Physics-based animations for interactive elements
6. **Pixi.js** - Advanced visual effects for hero sections
7. **Shader-park** - Geological texture and terrain visualizations

### Animation Strategy
- **Subtle Entrance**: Elements fade and slide in with staggered timing
- **Hover States**: 3D tilt effects on cards, color transitions on buttons
- **Scroll Motion**: Parallax effects on background elements (max 8% translation)
- **Loading States**: Geological layer animations for content loading
- **Interactive Feedback**: Immediate visual response to user actions

### Header Effects
- **Geological Layers**: Animated stratified background using shader effects
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time geological data charts and metrics
- **Particle Systems**: Subtle dust and particle effects suggesting geological activity

### Background Treatment
- **Consistent Base**: Subtle geological texture throughout all pages
- **Layered Depth**: Multiple background layers creating visual depth
- **Contextual Variations**: Slight color shifts to match page content
- **Interactive Elements**: Background responds to user interactions

## Layout & Composition

### Grid System
- **12-column responsive grid** with consistent gutters
- **Asymmetrical layouts** for visual interest while maintaining balance
- **Content hierarchy** through size, color, and positioning
- **Mobile-first** responsive design approach

### Spacing & Rhythm
- **8px base unit** for consistent spacing throughout
- **Golden ratio** proportions for major layout divisions
- **Breathing room** around interactive elements
- **Vertical rhythm** maintained across all text elements

### Interactive Elements
- **Card-based design** for projects, resources, and services
- **Tabbed interfaces** for method comparisons and tool categories
- **Modal overlays** for detailed content without page navigation
- **Progressive disclosure** to manage information density

## Imagery & Media

### Photography Style
- **High contrast** geological imagery with rich detail
- **Professional equipment** and fieldwork documentation
- **East African landscapes** showcasing regional expertise
- **Technical precision** in equipment and methodology shots

### Iconography
- **Line-based icons** with geological and technical themes
- **Consistent stroke weight** and style across all icons
- **Functional clarity** over decorative complexity
- **Scalable vector** format for all display sizes

### Data Visualization
- **Consistent color mapping** using brand palette
- **Clear legends** and axis labels
- **Interactive elements** for detailed data exploration
- **Export capabilities** for client presentations

This design system creates a cohesive, professional identity that positions Georesolve Africa as the premier geoscience consulting firm in East Africa while maintaining scientific credibility and modern usability.
